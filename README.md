# Generic Programming with Context Free Types

Provides generic programming functionality for context-free types.
It is similar to Haskell's uniplate in style.

## Organization

  - **CF** 
    - *Syntax*
    > Core syntactical elements.
    
    - *Equality*
    > Decidable equality
    
    - *Derivative*
    > Type-derivatives, a la McBride (2011).
    
    - *Measures*
    > Some usefull measures over generic elements.
    
    - *Operations*
    > Core operations divided in their specific categories:
    > - *Base*
      > Base operations: children, arity, forget, plug and unplug.
      
      - *Mu*
      > Operations specialized for working with fixed points.
      
      - *Vec*
      > Very similar to *Base*, but uses vectors instead of lists.
      
      - *Derivative*
      > Operations concerning type-derivatives
      
    - *Properties*
    > Properties satisfied by the defined operations.
